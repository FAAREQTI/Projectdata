# Data science project End2end

Welcome to the end-to-end project developed in collaboration with d2p company. This comprehensive data science endeavor is centered around the prediction of quantities for a supermarket business. Through this project, we aim to delve into various aspects of data engineering, data analysis, and forecasting, fostering a deeper understanding of these domains while delivering valuable insights for supermarket operations. Join us on this journey as we explore the intricate world of data-driven decision-making in the retail industry.

## Project description 

In this hypothetical project, we collaborate with a supermarket firm seeking to forecast sales across three cities over a specified time frame. Our primary focus lies in the realm of data engineering, where we extract, transform, and load relevant datasets for analysis. Additionally, we employ data science techniques to build accurate prediction models. Finally, we culminate the project by presenting a comprehensive dashboard that provides a concise summary of the results and insights gained from the analysis.
